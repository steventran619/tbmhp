          The Thomas Batterman Mental Health Project is named after Thomas Batterman, or Tom as his friends and family knew him. After a decades-long struggle with depression and substance abuse, Tom died by suicide in 2022. In his loving memory, Tom&#39;s wife and children established the Thomas Batterman Mental Health Project (TBMHP) with the goal of helping individuals facing similar challenges as those Tom and his family endured.
